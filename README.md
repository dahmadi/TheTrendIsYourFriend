Psuedo:
- read in data using alpacas (5 min chart). starting with QQQ
- format data for usage. variables to use OHLCV (open high low close volume?)
- code to establish what a double top or double bottom looks like (later on we can include other patterns)
- machine learning neural network to teach identification of the pattern.
- each compose independent neural network to identify what parameters work best.
- once model has learned to identify patterns implement a buy.
- program a trend (for upward trend we're working with higher highs (HH) and higher lows(HL) for downward trend we're working with lower highs (LH) and lower lows(LL))... like a staircase
- implement algorithm on QQQ
- report on profitability
- comapare and contrast to buy and hold trading method. and any other methods?
- what are the next steps? do we compare to another algo? another portfolio? compare to BRK?
